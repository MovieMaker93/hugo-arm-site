My portfolio and blog

My portfolio is created with hugo framework, you can find information [here](https://gohugo.io/)
I choose as theme the Toha theme and i customized it with my contents and configuration.

If you want to try it on local environment, pull it and :

`hugo server start`

The site is deployed to netlify configured through netlify.toml. 
Every commits to master repository, automaticaly trigger the deploy on netlify so the site is up to date everytime.
